##Personalisation as strategy
Going to collect materials here related to a project where the Yle Internet Media Development team is working out the need for personalised publishing and the manner in how a public service company should approach the question. The project consists of a number of workshops during September 2014.

###Overview
* Defining the problem
* Mapping current data and knowledge about the subject
* Finding out and learning what we need to understand through data, interviews, case-studies, observation etc.
* Sharing findings and stories, identifying patterns, insights, themes and opportunities.
* Barinstorming solutions and materials. Creating MVPs for the ideas, testing them and collecting immediate feedback.
* Identifying capabilities needed for the solutions.
* Planning a pipeline for solutions.
* Creating a implementation timeline.
* Plan MVPs
* Define evaluation criterias and iteration plans.
* First demo 6th of October.

### Criterias for problem definition
* Although we are getting used to it as users - and sometimes perhaps frustrated - personalisation might still require a mind shift away from a pure mass media paradigm. Communication of the idea needs to keep this in mind.
* A strong and clear case needs to be made why personalisation matters for Public Service Media, if it indeed matters.
* Resulting material should work as a basis for decisions that needs to be made this year and affect the resource allocations and focus for work that will be done in the next few years.
* A short condensed 10 minute demo of the results from this process will be done in 6th of October.
